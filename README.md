Spark App for The ACI App Center
Work in progress
This application will facilitate communication between Cisco's APIC[s] and administrators through the use of a Spark Bot.
The application will assign the Bot to a room designated by the administrator and will provide unsolicited updates to the room
based on predetermined severity thresholds. The admin will also be able to push policy and configurations to the controller[s] through
the spark room.
